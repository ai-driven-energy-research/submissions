# AIDER Submissions

This is where you submit a paper to **AI-Driven Energy Research (AIDER)**.

## How to Submit

### Step 1: Prepare your paper

Use the [paper-template](https://github.com/ai-driven-energy-research/paper-template) — click the green **"Use this template"** button to create your own repo with the correct structure.

Your repo must include:
- Paper manuscript (LaTeX or Markdown)
- All source code to reproduce results
- Data (or links to persistent data with DOI)
- Research process log (AI sessions + human decisions)
- Completed reproducibility checklist

### Step 2: Open a submission Issue

Click **[New Issue](../../issues/new/choose)** and select **"Paper Submission"**. Fill in the template with your paper details and a link to your repository.

### Step 3: Review

An editor will assign two reviewers. All review happens publicly:
- **Track A:** Scientific merit
- **Track B:** Reproducibility (reviewer runs your code — hard gate)

Reviews are open and signed. AI-assisted review is allowed with disclosure.

### Step 4: Acceptance

Once accepted, your repo is forked into the [ai-driven-energy-research](https://github.com/ai-driven-energy-research) org and listed on the [journal website](https://ai-driven-energy-research.github.io).
